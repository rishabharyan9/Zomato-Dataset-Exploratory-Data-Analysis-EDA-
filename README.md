# Zomato Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


# Overview
This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, which provides detailed information about restaurants, including their names, locations, cuisines offered, average cost for two, and ratings. The analysis aims to uncover insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and geographical distribution.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis consists of restaurant-related data sourced from Zomato. It includes attributes such as restaurant name, country code, city, address, locality, latitude, longitude, cuisines, average cost for two, currency, and various rating-related features.
